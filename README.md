# Key Analyses and Findings

**Data Cleaning:** Missing and redundant data were removed to ensure high-quality, accurate data.

**Feature Engineering:** To improve predictions, new features were added, such as the mortality rate and cases per 100,000 people.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Various plots and charts were created to visualize trends in confirmed cases and deaths.

**Predictive Modeling:** We built two forecasting models (ARIMA and Prophet) to predict future confirmed cases and deaths.
